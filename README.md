# Improved Expected Goals xG Model

Soccer is a game filled with passion, from the players to the coaches and even the fans you can witness the passion at games or in living rooms across the world as fans settle in to watch their favorite team.  Nothing elicits more passion than a goal; bringing highs, when your team scores, and lows, when your team is scored against.  This is the reason one of the only predictive models used in all of soccer is the Expected Goal (xG) Model.

The xG Model is controversial in soccer circles, with xG being known as a model that isn't particularly predictive, often overestimating the number of Goals that will be scored.

While the model appears to have faults, and will vary based on the company building it, I think the major fault is that all models I have found don't appear to use individual player data.

This project works to fix this issue adding data on:

  1. The player taking the shot
  2. The defense/defenders of the opponent
  3. The opponent's goalie
